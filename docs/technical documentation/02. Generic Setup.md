## Generic Setup

### Identity Provider

#### Requirement

- [x] Identity Providers are configured on CX-Central Realm level only
- [x] Identity Providers are Azure Active Directory, WebEAM, SAP, Amazon,...
- [x] Default Protocol used is OIDC
- [x] Users getting authenticated by an identity provider should only be able to login to the CX Services if a user in Keycloak is available
- [ ] ...

#### What's a Keycloak identity provider

An Identity Broker is an intermediary service connecting service providers with identity providers. The identity broker creates a relationship with an external identity provider to use the providerâ€™s identities to access the internal services the service provider exposes.

From a user perspective, identity brokers provide a user-centric, centralized way to manage identities for security domains and realms. You can link an account with one or more identities from identity providers or create an account based on the identity information from them.

An identity provider derives from a specific protocol used to authenticate and send authentication and authorization information to users. It can be:

- A social provider such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter.
- A business partner whose users need to access your services.
- A cloud-based identity service you want to integrate.

Typically, Keycloak bases identity providers on the following protocols:

- SAML v2.0
- OpenID Connect v1.0 ![Tag](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=CATENA-X-Standard&color=green&style=flat)
- OAuth v2.0

#### Brokering overview

When configuring Identity Providers in Keycloak, Keycloak does not force users to provide their credentials to authenticate in a specific realm.
Keycloak displays a list of identity providers from which they can authenticate.

If you configure a default identity provider, Keycloak redirects users to the default provider. For Catena-X, this is not necessary.

#### (Change) Identity Provider Display Name

The Identity Provider display name can get changed by the operator without any negative impact.
The change should still only get executed if necessarily needed. The change is resulting into a new IdP Button Name on the application login side.

#### Delete Identity Provider

There are a few different scenarios where the deletion of a identity provider within Keycloak might be needed.

- Company wants to move back to Shared CX IdP (currently not supported)
- Company is off-boarding from Catena-X
- Company is changing the company IdP internally (UI supported; no intervention by the platform operator needed)
- Identity Provider link to Shared IdP is not needed anymore (UI supported; no intervention by the platform operator needed)

More details regarding the function flow of deleting IdP's can get found here: [Get there](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-assets/blob/v1.6.1/docs/02.%20Technical%20Integration/02.%20Identity%20Provider%20Management/04.%20FAQ.md)

### Realms

> **Note**
> Realms don't get much detailed explained; since it is not planned that they are manually created; all realm related services are automated.

#### Requirement

- [x] Realm is created for each registration company
- [x] Realms are created inside the Shared IdP only; the Central IdP only holds the realms of the platform operator
- [x] A realm hold the user data of a company (kind of tenant management)
- [x] Roles and Groups are not managed on realm level
- [ ] ...

#### Realm Emails

Keycloak can send emails to users for several different scenario

- to verify the user email address
- to recreate a password in case it was forgotten
- or when an administrator needs to receive notifications about a server event

To enable Keycloak to send emails, SMTP server settings need to get configured by following steps:

- <strong>Login</strong> to the respective Keycloak instance and open the relevant realm
- Click <strong>Realm Settings</strong> in the menu.
- Click the <strong>Email</strong> tab.
- Fill in the fields and toggle the switches as needed.

> **Note**
> The email realm config is automatically taking place when a realm is getting created; no manual adjustments needed. However the config of the email service attributes is needed via the env. var files.

###### Host

SMTP server hostname used for sending emails.

###### Port

SMTP server port.

###### From

Address used for the From SMTP-Header for the emails sent.

###### From Display Name

Allows to configure a user friendly email address aliases (optional). If not set the plain From email address will be displayed in email clients.

###### Reply To

Reply To denotes the address used for the Reply-To SMTP-Header for the mails sent (optional). If not set the plain From email address will be used.

###### Reply To Display Name

Reply To Display Name allows to configure a user friendly email address aliases (optional). If not set the plain Reply To email address will be displayed.

###### Envelope From

Envelope From denotes the Bounce Address used for the Return-Path SMTP-Header for the mails sent (optional).Enable SSL and Enable StartTSLToggle one of these switches to ON to support sending emails for recovering usernames and passwords, especially if the SMTP server is on an external network. You will most likely need to change the Port to 465, the default port for SSL/TLS.

###### Enable Authentication

Set this to ON if your SMTP server requires authentication. When prompted, supply the Username and Password.
