### Technical Setup

Helm charts using the Bitnami chart as dependency:

* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/blob/v1.2.0/charts/centralidp/Chart.yaml#L29>
* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/blob/v1.2.0/charts/sharedidp/Chart.yaml#L29>

Realm import during startup:

* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/blob/v1.2.0/charts/centralidp/values.yaml#L43>
* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/blob/v1.2.0/charts/sharedidp/values.yaml#L43>
* <https://wjw465150.gitbooks.io/keycloak-documentation/content/server_admin/topics/export-import.html>

Seeding job:

* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/blob/v1.2.0/charts/centralidp/values.yaml#L155>
* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-backend/tree/v1.2.0-iam/src/keycloak/Keycloak.Seeding>
* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-backend/blob/v1.2.0-iam/docker/Dockerfile-iam-seeding>

Init container for realm import and seeding job:

* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/blob/v1.2.0/docker/Dockerfile.import>
* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/blob/v1.2.0/docker/Dockerfile.consortia.import>
* <https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/tree/v1.2.0/import>

## Roadmap

### Version Upgrade

### Get rid of initial realm import and replace it with our .Net seeding job

The seeding job needs to be enhanced for the management of config within the helm chart: variables (e.g. env specific redirects) and secrets (client secrets in k8s secrets)

### Provide solution for issue related to User Token Lifespan setting

Set revokeRefreshToken to false to prevent page reload on token refresh: <https://github.com/catenax-ng/product-portal-iam/pull/25>

### Sustainable sharedidp setup

* Keycloak is slow after many realms are created
* Admin console not even accessible anymore
* Concept for multiple shared instances should be defined

## Preliminary exploration regarding version upgrade

<https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/pull/20>

Upgrade to v22.0.1: <https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/keycloak/16.1.0>

## Workshops

### 1rst workshop (Sep 27th, 2023)

* Feedback on current setup:
  * How sustainable is our setup?
  * Should we think about forking Keycloak / developing Keycloak on our own to gain more flexibility?
  * Within our current setup: do you have suggestions for improvements?
  * Possibly the topic of [sustainable sharedidp setup](#sustainable-sharedidp-setup) can already be covered to some extent to get some ideas how to approach it.

* [Version upgrade](#version-upgrade) [coming from v16.1.1]:
  * do you see reasons why not to upgrade to v22?
    * recommendation in regards of security <https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/keycloak/16.1.0?modal=security-report>
    * possible stability issues being such a new version <https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/upgrading/index.html>
  * dive into possible challenges, to list already the forseeable ones:
    * define deployment approach for upgrade (reusable also for future version upgrades)
    * clarify on major postgres upgrade (14 to 15)
  * explore new features
    * for instance and not limited to an introduction to Quarkus (optimized for containers)

## 2nd workshop (Oct 5th, 2023)

* [User Token Lifespan](#provide-solution-for-issue-related-to-user-token-lifespan-setting)

One aspect of this issue is that the setting 'revokeRefreshToken=true' on CX-Central realm level is causing page reload in our frontend.
We want a better understanding of the dependencies between our CX-Central realm configuration details and frontend application.

Below you find two of the most important files related to this issue.

Specific CX-Central realm config:

https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-iam/blob/main/import/realm-config/generic/catenax-central/CX-Central-realm.json#L7

Portal Authentication:

https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-frontend/blob/main/src/index.tsx

https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-frontend/blob/main/src/services/UserService.ts#L53-L89

The other aspect of this issue is the expiration of access token or more specifically the lack of it:
We observed that the access tokens generated by the CX-Central realm for users aren't invalidated once their expiration time has expired and if no logout is performed from the frontend application level.
What is more, the generated access tokens are not invalidated immediately after the user logs out of the application, but only after exceeding the expiration time.
For service accounts we even observed that the access tokens appear to never expire. We can still login with a access token after one week.

Below you find the configuration of the CX-Central realm:
