# Seeding of custom realms

To add the custom realms to the centralidp and sharedidp instances maintained in the [import/realm-config directory](/import/realm-config/), a seeding job written in dotnet and executed as part of Kubernetes jobs.

The seeding job itself is currently is maintained in the portal-backend repository, but it's planned to move it this repository (see [sig-release#855](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/855)).

The job is highly configurable, for instance environment specific URLs and client secrets can be seeded, please see [Keycloak.Seeding/README.md](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-backend/blob/v4.0.0-iam/src/keycloak/Keycloak.Seeding/README.md) for more details.

It is used to seed - initially and at upgrade:

- the CX-Central realm into centralidp and
- the CX-Operator realm into sharedidp,

for the master realm in sharedidp it also seeds two service accounts as well as the entities connected to those (users and and `cx-admin`role). For the detailed configuration please see:

- [seeding job for centralidp](/charts/centralidp/templates/job-seeding.yaml) and
- [seeding job for sharedidp](/charts/sharedidp/templates/job-seeding.yaml)

As well as the configuration in the values.yaml files under `Values.realmSeeding`.
