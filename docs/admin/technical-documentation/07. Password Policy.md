# Password Policy

## General details

Password Policies are restrictions and/or requirements that a user must follow to ensure that their password is strong/secure.
In Keycloak, password policies are set per realm.

### Requirement of a Passwort Policy

- [ ] Default Password Policies are needed for every realm - the policies are set by Catena-X and identical for all realms
- [ ] Password refresh every 90 days
- [ ] Password length 15+ digits
- [ ] Password characters: letters + minimum 1 number is mandatory
- [ ] Password shouldn't be the same as the username or email
- [ ] If the Password is getting reset by the user and is not fitting the password policies, a error message with a detailed error code will get shown

### How to configure Password Policies

Open Keycloak admin page, go to "Authentication" and open the "Password Policy" tab.
Click on the **Add policy** … to see the list of available password policies.

![PasswordPolicy](/docs/static/password-policy.png)

Select the relevant policy and set the policy value by adding the relevant number. Important: only numbers are to be added, no letters.  
After saving the policy, Keycloak login enforces the policy for new users. Existing users can still login with their old password, but as soon as a password change request is getting triggered the new policies will take affect.

Blacklisting passwords is possible via UTF-8 file, for Catena-X no blacklisting is planned so far.

### Implementation of a Password Policy

Password Policies are auto set (as per the definition mentioned above) for each company tenant.
With the new creation of an company tenant; the password policies are automatically configured for the respective realm inside the sharedIdP.

## Password Reset

If Password reset is enabled, users are able to reset their credentials if they forget their password or lose their OTP generator.

### Requirement of a Password Reset

- [ ] Forgot Password option should be available for all users using Shared IdP
- [ ] New Password needs to get validated against the configured Password Policies
- [ ] Config needs to get automatically set whenever a new realm is getting created

### How to configure Password Recovery

Go to the Realm Settings left menu item, and click on the Login tab. Switch on the Forgot Password switch.

![PasswordRecovery](/docs/static/password-recovery.png)

The new password will get send via email.

The email text is fully configurable. How: extend or edit the theme associated with it.

When the user clicks on the email link, they will be asked to update their password, and, if they have an OTP generator set up, they will also be asked to reconfigure this as well. Depending on the security requirements of your organization you may not want users to be able to reset their OTP generator through email. You can change this behavior by going to the Authentication left menu item, clicking on the Flows tab, and selecting the Reset Credentials flow.
