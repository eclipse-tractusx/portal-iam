# Roles & Rights

## 1. General details

### 1.1 Scope and binding force of the document

#### Overview

The Roles & Rights concept is a key component of the System Implementation for Catena-X. It specifies the roles, authorizations and controls that must be implemented within the Catena-X ecosystem.

#### Objectives

The Roles & Rights Concept aims to provide a high-level description of the planning and implementation of roles and rights in the context of Catena-X. It defines the required functions, structures and basic principles, while providing an illustrative description of specific roles and associated rights.

#### Key Elements

- Defines the relevant roles, authorizations and controls for Catena-X
- Describes the functions, structures and principles underlying the roles and rights
- Includes an illustrative representation of specific roles and associated rights
- Serves as a high-level description of the implemented roles and rights in Catena-X

#### Significance

The Roles & Rights Concept is a crucial part of the Catena-X System Implementation, as it establishes the foundational access controls and permissions necessary for the secure and efficient operation of the ecosystem. It ensures a standardized approach to user management and access rights across the Catena-X network.

## 2. Authorization structure and role model

This chapter explains the business, organizational, and technical principles of the role and authorization definition, thereby illustrating the relationship between business function and authorization structure. The objective is to make the actual authorizations and authorization assignments granted in the new Catena-X solution verifiable against the business, technical, and organizational specifications, specified in this document.

### 2.4 Role definition & Naming convention

#### 2.4.1 Role Definition

In the concept of the roles and rights management we differentiate between roles and permissions.

Permissions are the lowest level that a user can have. Several permissions are collected into a role.

The assignment of rights to an actual user happens at the role level itself.

It is suggested to setup a naming convention for roles and permissions to ensure that they can get clearly defined.

On the CX Portal side, the conventions are setup as follows._Please note that this is not mandatory for 3rd Party Providers to follow._

#### 2.4.2 Naming Convention

##### Permissions

- always lowercase
- no spaces, only use underscore
- task/role needs to be clearly understandable
- don't use any "Umlaute" (special character) such as: ä, ü, ö
- a permission can get assigned to several roles, but one is the minimum role to which it need to be assigned

##### Roles

- capital letters to be used for 1st character
- spaces are allowed
- role should be identifiable
- don't use any "Umlaute" (special character) such as: ä, ü, ö
- a role needs as a minimum 1 permission assigned to it

### 2.5 Role/Permission Matrix

This role concept covers all roles related to

- Registration/Onboarding Process Roles
- Portal Roles

### 2.6 Segregation of duties

The concept of segregation of duties involves having more than one person or role required to complete a task. However, this scenario does not currently exist within the portal.

## 3. Global subjects

This chapter provides an overview of how the Catena-X Platform is integrated into the broader business partner application landscape, as well as the key infrastructure components connected to it for authorization management. Additionally, the text outlines technical restrictions, naming conventions, audit logging, and authentication mechanisms in more detail.

### 3.1 Authorization management connections

Authorization management is handled in the CX central Identity Provider (IdP).

### 3.2 Used infrastructure components

- TBD

### 3.3 Privileged and technical user accounts

Technical users are typically used for backend-to-backend connections. This includes connections within the CX system, as well as outbound connections between member companies and CX components.

For example, a third-party app may connect to the central registry.

### 3.4 Technical restrictions

For a detailed description of how the internal security system works please refer to Security Concept. In terms of the Catena-X Platform, this approach brings the following technical restrictions:

A new login is required for user rights changes to take effect
The fact that the rights for a particular user are only read at user login and then cached for the session implicates, that changes to rights can only take effect after a new user login.

### 3.5 Logging

Logging actions that can lead to granting or revocation of authorizations must observe the legal privacy specifications. Access to the logs is restricted. This is allowed only if there is legitimate interest and if it is according to the legal regulations for privacy.

For the Catena-X Platform, there are three types of logging the use:

- System internal audit history
- System external monitoring system
- System technical server logs

Internal audit history, an on screen audit record is available for key screens. This functionality is restricted to particular roles (see section 2.5). The following information can be viewed tabular within the System:
..

All internal audit and access logs are saved ???.
The retention period for audit history is 7 years. After this period the audit history can be deleted, however this is not mandatory in legal terms.

Finally, each infrastructure component and all surrounding systems have their own logging solutions in use. This includes the logging of grants and revoked of user access rights in the central BMW access management system. However, details on these technical logging solutions are out of scope for the Roles & Rights concept.

## 4. Authorization procedure

User permission / access withdrawal are possible via

- Company IT Admin is able to withdraw user rights/permissions
- Company IT Admin can delete company users under the same org
- Company User can delete his/her own user account
- App provider can withdraw app usage for a company, but not for a single user
