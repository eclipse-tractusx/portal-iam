# Release Process

The release process for a new version can roughly be divided into the following steps:

- [Release Process](#release-process)
  - [Preparations on the release branch](#preparations-on-the-release-branch)
    - [1. Version bump](#1-version-bump)
    - [2. Update README (on chart level)](#2-update-readme-on-chart-level)
  - [Update CHANGELOG.md](#update-changelogmd)
  - [Merge release branch](#merge-release-branch)
  - [RC: provide successive rc branch and change base of open PRs](#rc-provide-successive-rc-branch-and-change-base-of-open-prs)
  - [NOTICE](#notice)

The process builds on the [Development Flow](../dev-process/Dev%20Flow.md) which, usually, takes place within forks and leads to merged pull requests in the repositories of the eclipse-tractusx organization.

For assigning and incrementing **version** numbers [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) is followed.

## Preparations on the release branch

Checking out from the main branch a release branch (release/{to be released version} e.g. release/v1.2.0, or respectively release/v1.2.0-rc.1 for a release candidate).
On the release branch the following steps are executed:

### 1. Version bump

Bump the chart and app version in the `Chart.yaml` files.

- [centralidp/Chart.yaml](/charts/centralidp/Chart.yaml)
- [sharedidp/Chart.yaml](/charts/sharedidp/Chart.yaml)

And bump the version of the images for the init container and realm seeding job in the `values.yaml` files:

- [centralidp/values.yaml](/charts/centralidp/values.yaml)
- [sharedidp/values.yaml](/charts/sharedidp/values.yaml)

_environment relevant: Update the version of the targetRevision tag in the [argocd-app-templates](/environments/argocd-app-templates/), used for hosted environments._

Example for commit message:

_build: bump version for vx.x.x_

### 2. Update README (on chart level)

Use [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) (gotemplate driven) for updating the README file.

```bash
helm-docs --chart-search-root [charts-dir] --sort-values-order file
```

Example for commit message:

_build: update readme for vx.x.x_

## Update CHANGELOG.md

The changelog file tracks all notable changes since the last released version.
Once a new version is ready to be released, the changelog can get updated via an automatically created pull request using the [release-please workflow](/.github/workflows/release-please.yml) which can be triggered manually or by pushing a _changelog/v*.*.*_ branch.

Please see:

- [How release please works](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action/tree/v4.0.2?tab=readme-ov-file#how-release-please-works)
- [How do I change the version number?](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/tree/v16.7.0?tab=readme-ov-file#how-do-i-change-the-version-number)
- [How can I fix release notes?](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/tree/v16.7.0?tab=readme-ov-file#how-can-i-fix-release-notes)

## Merge release branch

The release branch must be merged into main.
Those merges need to happen via PRs.

Example for PR titles:

_build(1.2.0): merge release into main_

> Be aware that the merge into main triggers the workflow with the [helm chart releaser action](/.github/workflows/release.yaml).
>
> The workflow creates a 'centralidp-x.x.x' and 'sharedidp-x.x.x' tags and according releases. The release contains the new chart.
>
> This workflow also pushes the version tag that triggers the [release workflow](/.github/workflows/release.yaml) which creates the versioned docker image/s.

_environment relevant: The 'vx.x.x' tag is used to install (with the convenience of the argocd-app-templates) or upgrade the version via AgroCD on the hosted K8s clusters._

## RC: provide successive rc branch and change base of open PRs

During a release candidate phase, checkout the successive 'rc' branch and push it to the server, so that it can be used for further bugfixes.

Example:

```bash
git checkout tags/v0.1.0-rc.2 -b release/v0.1.0-rc.3
```

Also make sure to change the base of all open pull requests still pointing to the previous 'rc' branch to the newly pushed 'rc' branch.
